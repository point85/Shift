# Shift
The Shift library project manages work schedules.  A work schedule consists of one or more teams who rotate through a sequence of shift and off-shift periods of time.  The Shift project allows breaks during shifts to be defined as well as non-working periods of time (e.g. holidays and scheduled maintenance periods) that are applicable to the entire work schedule.  This java library is used in an OEE project that can be found at https://github.com/point85/OEE-Designer.  The Shift library is also available in C# at https://github.com/point85/ShiftSharp.

## Concepts

The diagram below illustrates Business Management Systems' DNO (Day, Night, Off) work schedule with three teams and two 12-hour shifts with a 3-day rotation.  This schedule is explained in http://community.bmscentral.com/learnss/ZC/3T/c3tr12-1.

![Work Schedule Diagram](https://github.com/point85/shift/blob/master/doc/DNO.png)

*Shift*

A shift is defined with a name, description, starting time of day and duration.  An off-shift period is associated with a shift.  In the example above for Team1, there are two shifts followed by one off-shift period.  Shifts can be overlapped (typically when a handoff of duties is important such as in the nursing profession).  A rotation is a sequence of shifts and off-shift days.  The DNO rotation is Day on, Night on and Night off.  An instance of a shift has a starting date and time of day and has an associated shift definition.

*Team*

A team is defined with a name and description.  It has a rotation with a starting date.  The starting date shift will have an instance with that date and a starting time of day as defined by the shift.  The same rotation can be shared between more than one team, but with different starting times.

*Work Schedule*

A work schedule is defined with a name and description.  It has one or more teams.  Zero or more non-working periods can be defined.  A non-working period has a defined starting date and time of day and duration.  For example, the New Year's Day holiday starting at midnight for 24 hours, or three consecutive days for preventive maintenance of manufacturing equipment starting at the end of the night shift. 

After a work schedule is defined, the working time for all shifts can be computed for a defined time interval.  For example, this duration of time is the maximum available productive time as an input to the calculation of the utilization of equipment in a metric known as the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).

*Rotation*

A rotation is a sequence of working periods (segments).  Each segment starts with a shift and specifies the number of days on-shift and off-shift.  A work schedule can have more than one rotation.

*Non-Working Period*

A non-working period is a duration of time where no teams are working.  For example, a holiday or a period of time when a plant is shutdown for preventative maintenance.  A non-working period starts at a defined day and time of day and continues for the specified duration of time.

*Shift Instance*

A shift instance is the duration of time from a specified date and time of day and continues for the duration of the associated shift.  A team works this shift instance.

## Examples
The DNO schedule discussed above is defined as follows.

```java
String description = "This is a fast rotation plan that uses 3 teams and two 12-hr shifts to provide 24/7 coverage. "
		+ "Each team rotates through the following sequence every three days: 1 day shift, 1 night shift, and 1 day off.";

WorkSchedule schedule = new WorkSchedule("DNO Plan", description);

// Day shift, starts at 07:00 for 12 hours
Shift day = schedule.createShift("Day", "Day shift", LocalTime.of(7, 0, 0), Duration.ofHours(12));

// Night shift, starts at 19:00 for 12 hours
Shift night = schedule.createShift("Night", "Night shift", LocalTime.of(19, 0, 0), Duration.ofHours(12));

// rotation
Rotation rotation = new Rotation("DNO", "DNO");
rotation.addSegment(day, 1, 0);
rotation.addSegment(night, 1, 1);

schedule.createTeam("Team 1", "First team", rotation, referenceDate);
schedule.createTeam("Team 2", "Second team", rotation, referenceDate.minusDays(1));
schedule.createTeam("Team 3", "Third team", rotation, referenceDate.minusDays(2));
```
To obtain the working time over three days starting at 07:00, the following methods are called:

```java
LocalDateTime from = LocalDateTime.of(referenceDate, LocalTime.of(7, 0, 0));
Duration duration = schedule.calculateWorkingTime(from, from.plusDays(3));
```

To obtain the shift instances for a date, the following method is called:

```java
List<ShiftInstance> instances = schedule.getShiftInstancesForDay(LocalDate.of(2017, 3, 1)); 
```

To print a work schedule, call the toString() method.  For example:

```java
Schedule: DNO Plan (This is a fast rotation plan that uses 3 teams and two 12-hr shifts to provide 24/7 coverage. Each team rotates through the following sequence every three days: 1 day shift, 1 night shift, and 1 day off.)
Rotation duration: PT216H, Scheduled working time: PT72H
Shifts: 
   (1) Day (Day shift), Start : 07:00 (PT12H), End : 19:00
   (2) Night (Night shift), Start : 19:00 (PT12H), End : 07:00
Teams: 
   (1) Team 1 (First team), Rotation start: 2016-10-31, Rotation periods: [Day (on), Night (on), (off) ], Rotation duration: PT72H, Days in rotation: 3, Scheduled working time: PT24H, Percentage worked: 33.33%, Average hours worked per week: PT56H
   (2) Team 2 (Second team), Rotation start: 2016-10-30, Rotation periods: [Day (on), Night (on),(off) ], Rotation duration: PT72H, Days in rotation: 3, Scheduled working time: PT24H, Percentage worked: 33.33%, Average hours worked per week: PT56H
   (3) Team 3 (Third team), Rotation start: 2016-10-29, Rotation periods: [Day (on), Night (on), (off) ], Rotation duration: PT72H, Days in rotation: 3, Scheduled working time: PT24H, Percentage worked: 33.33%, Average hours worked per week: PT56H
Total team coverage: 100%
```

To print shift instances between two dates, the following method is called:

 ```java
schedule.printShiftInstances(LocalDate.of(2016, 10, 31), LocalDate.of(2016, 11, 3)));
```
with output:

```java
Working shifts
[1] Day: 2016-10-31
   (1) Team: Team 1, Shift: Day, Start : 2016-10-31T07:00, End : 2016-10-31T19:00
   (2) Team: Team 2, Shift: Night, Start : 2016-10-31T19:00, End : 2016-11-01T07:00
[2] Day: 2016-11-01
   (1) Team: Team 3, Shift: Day, Start : 2016-11-01T07:00, End : 2016-11-01T19:00
   (2) Team: Team 1, Shift: Night, Start : 2016-11-01T19:00, End : 2016-11-02T07:00
[3] Day: 2016-11-02
   (1) Team: Team 2, Shift: Day, Start : 2016-11-02T07:00, End : 2016-11-02T19:00
   (2) Team: Team 3, Shift: Night, Start : 2016-11-02T19:00, End : 2016-11-03T07:00
[4] Day: 2016-11-03
   (1) Team: Team 1, Shift: Day, Start : 2016-11-03T07:00, End : 2016-11-03T19:00
   (2) Team: Team 2, Shift: Night, Start : 2016-11-03T19:00, End : 2016-11-04T07:00
```
 
For a second example, the 24/7 schedule below has two rotations for four teams in two shifts.  It is used by manufacturing companies.

```java
WorkSchedule schedule = new WorkSchedule("Manufacturing Company - four twelves",
	"Four 12 hour alternating day/night shifts");

// day shift, start at 07:00 for 12 hours
Shift day = schedule.createShift("Day", "Day shift", LocalTime.of(7, 0, 0), Duration.ofHours(12));

// night shift, start at 19:00 for 12 hours
Shift night = schedule.createShift("Night", "Night shift", LocalTime.of(19, 0, 0), Duration.ofHours(12));

// 7 days ON, 7 OFF
Rotation dayRotation = new Rotation("Day", "Day");
dayRotation.addSegment(day, 7, 7);

// 7 nights ON, 7 OFF
Rotation nightRotation = new Rotation("Night", "Night");
nightRotation.addSegment(night, 7, 7);

schedule.createTeam("A", "A day shift", dayRotation, LocalDate.of(2014, 1, 2));
schedule.createTeam("B", "B night shift", nightRotation, LocalDate.of(2014, 1, 2));
schedule.createTeam("C", "C day shift", dayRotation, LocalDate.of(2014, 1, 9));
schedule.createTeam("D", "D night shift", nightRotation, LocalDate.of(2014, 1, 9));
```

When printed out for a week of shift instances, the output is:

```java

For a third example, the work schedule below with one 24 hour shift over an 18 day rotation for three platoons is used by Kern County California firefighters.

```java
WorkSchedule schedule = new WorkSchedule("Kern Co.", "Three 24 hour alternating shifts");

// shift, start 07:00 for 24 hours
Shift shift = schedule.createShift("24 Hour", "24 hour shift", LocalTime.of(7, 0, 0), Duration.ofHours(24));

// 2 days ON, 2 OFF, 2 ON, 2 OFF, 2 ON, 8 OFF
Rotation rotation = new Rotation("24 Hour", "2 days ON, 2 OFF, 2 ON, 2 OFF, 2 ON, 8 OFF");
rotation.addSegment(shift, 2, 2);
rotation.addSegment(shift, 2, 2);
rotation.addSegment(shift, 2, 8);

Team platoon1 = schedule.createTeam("Red", "A Shift", rotation, LocalDate.of(2017, 1, 8));
Team platoon2 = schedule.createTeam("Black", "B Shift", rotation, LocalDate.of(2017, 2, 1));
Team platoon3 = schedule.createTeam("Green", "C Shift", rotation, LocalDate.of(2017, 1, 2));
```

## Work Schedule Application
An example work schedule application has been built to demonstrate fundamental capabilities of the library.  The user interface is implemented in JavaFX 8 and database persistency is provided by JPA 2.2 (Java Persistence API) with FXML descriptors in the shift_orm.xml file.  Hibernate is the JPA implementation for a Microsoft SQL Server 2008 database.

The editor allows new schedules to be created and saved to the database as well as updated and deleted.

The screen capture below shows shift instances for the month of June, 2017 with the DNO schedule selected.
![DNO Instances Diagram](https://github.com/point85/shift/blob/master/doc/ShiftInstances.png)

The "Editor ..." button launches the editor (see below).  To display shift instances, follow these steps:
*  Select the schedule in the drop-down, e.g. DNO Plan.  
*  Choose the beginning date from the picker and enter the beginning time of day (hour:minute)
*  Choose the ending date from the picker and enter the ending time of day (hour:minute)
*  Click the "Show Shifts" button.  The shift instances starting in each day will be displayed in the table along with the total working and non-working time for each such shift instance. 

The screen capture below shows the work schedule editor with the Shift tab selected.

![Schedule Editor Diagram](https://github.com/point85/shift/blob/master/doc/NonWorkingEditor.png)

To create a work schedule, click the "New" button and follow these steps:
*  Enter a name and description.
*  Select the Shifts tab.  Click New and enter the shift information.  Click Add to create a shift.  To update a shift, select it in the table, edit the information and click Update.  Click Remove to delete it.
*  Follow these steps for the Rotations, Teams and Non-working Periods tabs.
*  Click the "Save" button.  The new work schedule will appear in the list view on the left

To edit a work schedule, select it in the list view.  It's properties will be displayed on the right.  Change properties as required, then click the "Save" button.

To refresh the state of the work schedule that is selected in the list view from the database, click the "Refresh" button.

To delete a work schedule, select it in the list view then click the "Delete" button.
