Bugs Fixed:
Named.java - Fixed equals/hashCode contract violation

Changed equals() to use Objects.equals() for proper null handling
Changed hashCode() to use Objects.hash() for consistency
Fixed toString() to handle null description gracefully
RotationSegment.java - Added null safety checks

Added defensive null checks before calling getName() on rotation and shift to prevent NullPointerException
ShiftInstance.java - Added null safety checks

Added defensive null checks in equals() method to prevent NullPointerException

Performance Improvements:
Team.java - Optimized cache synchronization

Replaced ConcurrentHashMap with HashMap since the method is already synchronized
Improved cache initialization logic to avoid unnecessary clear operations
Optimized string concatenation in toString() methods (replaced += with StringBuilder)
